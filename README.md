# Computer-Vision-University-Course - Mini Projects of my University Course on Computer Vision
The MATLAB files of the mini projects I carried out for my Computer Vision course at Cairo University, as part of my degree in Biomedical and Systems Engineering.

The projects cover the following topics:

1. Image filtering and processing 
2. Edge and boundary detection (Hough transform and SNAKE)
3. Feature point detection, features descriptors (SIFT) and image matching (SSD and normalized cross correlation)
4. Segmentation
5. Face detection
